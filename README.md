# Week Visualization
For my school's values class, we were tasked to log every hour of our week. I visualized mine by encoding my week in data that is visualized with Python's matplotlib library.

I procrastinated heavy on Monday, but I think that was a really productive week.

More proof that I've been productive, except for Monday where for some reason I became a vegetable.

I got an average of 8 hours of sleep everyday! But I'm kinda cheating cuz I sleep like 5 or 6 hours everyday then take a long 3 hour nap right in the middle.

Not a very social week, my best friend was really busy.
